# flio
Fli-O was developed to create a seamless way for users to interact with files, especially large documents that require file or directory manipulation. 

# Hello World
To test our hello world program, please build our project using `make` in the /src directory. The hello world program is /test\_suite/test-hello.f. The program can be converted into LLVM IR using the command `./flio.native -c ../test\_suite/test_hello.c` while in the src directory.
